# Exploring Arctic Sea Ice Extent time series from NSIDC
Using Python and R to analyze the sea ice extent series for the period 1978-2020.

[seaice_extent.ipynb](https://github.com/rcruzgar/analyses/blob/master/nsidc_seaice/seaice_extent.ipynb): R Notebook analyzing the monthly trends and anomalies.

[Sequential_Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/rcruzgar/analyses/blob/master/Sequential_Prediction.ipynb): Python Notebook that creates a sequential deep-learning model to predict the time series of daily Arctic sea ice extent.

[Arctic_Climate.ipynb](https://github.com/rcruzgar/analyses/blob/master/nsidc_seaice/Arctic_Climate.ipynb): Plot some the heatmap of Arctic sea ice anomalies and compares it with global temperature anomalies. Made in Python.

[prediction_ARIMA.ipynb](https://github.com/rcruzgar/analyses/blob/master/nsidc_seaice/prediction_ARIMA.ipynb): Building a model with ARIMA to predict the sea ice extent time series. Made in R.
